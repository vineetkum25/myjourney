                    <li>Hired a software agency to create a digital voucher card platform.</li>
                    <li>Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, product development and market testing were delayed. Once the lockdown was lifted, I tested the product directly with retail shop owners.</li>

                <h2>2021-2023 – Focused on Programming & Technology related skills.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Realized that mastering programming was essential for turning my startup ideas into reality and could also serve as a backup for launching a <strong>software development agency</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated these years to learning <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>mobile app development</strong>, and other key technical skills.</li>
                    <li>Worked on two <strong >forum websites</strong> to practice programming and test their market potential:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>First Forum Website:</strong> Created a forum where users could access discussion pages by typing in the <strong>industry name</strong> and <strong>region name</strong>. This allowed professionals to connect based on their industry and location.</li>
                            <li><strong>Second Forum Website:</strong> Built a forum where users could <strong>embed their social media posts</strong> directly into the forum pages, enabling them to showcase and promote their content and social media profiles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Both forum websites failed to gain user interest and engagement during the testing phase with a small group of users. However, working on these projects greatly <strong>increased my confidence in programming</strong> as I gained hands-on experience with real-world applications.</li>
